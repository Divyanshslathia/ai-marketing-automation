# Design Notes for the Project.

This project is mare prototype and MVP so this doesnt have the best practices and production ready Arctitecture implemented so things ill like to do better for putting it into production would be as follows--

## Using LangChain instead of Plain python classes 
-Orchestration is not manual 

-Easier chaining and branching of agent flows

-Better observability and tracing of AI decisions

-Easier experimentation with different prompts and models
